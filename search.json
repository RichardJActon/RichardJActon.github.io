    "text": "For anyone unfamiliar with Rnotebooks here is a quick overview of why you might want to use them more experienced users can skip ahead. Rnotebooks are scientific notebooks for R, somewhat like jupyter for anyone coming from python but baked right into the Rstudio IDE which offers some benefits over the browser based interface of jupyter. It permits you to organise your code, notes, reasoning and references in one place. Combining Rnotebooks with a version management system such as git gives a robustness similar paper lab book records when it comes to seeing what you did and when coupled with dynamism, portability, share-ability and ease of backup of electronic working. Rnotebooks use a simple flavour of markdown with options to render output to HTML and PDF (via LaTeX) formats. Rnotebooks also have big pluses for reproducibility, creating an Rnotebook that does, explains and references your analysis makes it very easy to give to another at least somewhat competent R user and have them re-run your analysis - potentially with their own variants. Reproducibility and verifiability are substantial issues in scientific computing, including my own field of biology. A recent article in PeerJ provides a nice discussion of these issues and a look at what the future of scientific computing notebooks might resemble.\n\n\nRaw Rmarkdown looks like this:\n---\ntitle: \"Example Rnotebook\" # a yaml header with document properties and options\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\nMardown formatted text, with __Bold__ and *exciting!* Scientific claims\nabout $in-line math^2$ at least according to @Smith2007.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"some actual R code in chunks\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nsaved with a .Rmd file extension\nRstudio of course adds nice syntax highlighting, and various bells and whistles."

    "text": "Bibliograghy and Citation YAML options\nPlacing a bibliography option in your Rnotebook’s header and pointing it to a bibtex file containing your citation information permits you to create citations in Rnotebooks using the following syntax: @Smith2016 for an in-line citation e.g. ‘work by Smith et al. 2016 showed that cheese…’ or [@Smith2016] for a reference like this: ‘assertion (Smith et al. 2016)’, or even lists of citations to be contracted where possible given the citation style e.g. [@Smith2016; @Jones2018], (note the semi-colon list separator) yielding something like this: ‘assertion [1-2]’\nI frequently use a header that contains code like this:\n---\nbibliography: \"bib.bib\"\nparams:\n  bib: \"~/Documents/bibtex/library.bib\"\n---\nThe reason I do this is my bibliography has the same path relative to my home directory on my laptop, desktop and computing clusters but the absolute paths differ and these headers seem to prefer absolute paths. Thus, if I compose a notebook on one system it won’t execute on another unless I change the path or use a set-up like this to do so dynamically when building the notebook.\nI also frequently set the path to my working directory as a parameter to my Rnotebooks and use relative paths to any files I want to load/write in the body of the Rnotebook so as to achieve similar portability between the different system’s I work on as I get with my bibliography files.\nThe following chunk sets the working directory for when you ‘knit’ your Rnotebook into the desired format in the first line and for interactive sessions in the second.\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = normalizePath(params$pwd))\nsetwd(params$pwd)\n```\n:::\nA note on generating your bibtex file(s). I currently use Mendeley as my refernce manager and it has a nice bibtext output option which is automatically updated whenever you sync (On balance I would probably recomend Zotero to someone starting out afresh with reference management but its bibtex output is not quite as convenient as Mendeley’s)\nIf you have multiple bibliography files this can be done:\nbibliography: [multiple.bib, dotbib.bib, files.bib]\nIncluding a csl option allows you to specify a citation style using the .csl format. The specific citations styles of numerous journals in .csl format can be found here. Including the link-citations: yes option will create hyperlinks from the in-text references to the full citations at the end of the document.\nBy default the bibliography is placed at the very end of your document, so simply placing a # References header at the end of your document helps to separate your bibliography from the body of your text and puts an entry for it in the table of contents. If however you have some appendices to add after your references placing this HTML snippet in your Rnotebook should set the position at which the references will be rendered: <div id=\"refs\"></div>. Helpfully this will set the postion in both HTML and PDF outputs. (This may not work with older versions of pandoc)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Why rationalists should care (more) about free software\nespecially if you want to upload your brain\n\nIn the limit condition freedom of compute is freedom of thought.\n\nAs we offload more of our cognition to our computational devices we expose a new threat surface for attacks on our ability to think free of malign or otherwise misaligned influence. The parties who control the computational systems to which you have outsourced your cognition have a vector by which to influence your thinking. This may be a problem for you if their interests are not aligned with your own as they can use this power to manipulate you in service of their goals and against your own.\nThe fundamental operations of our brains remain difficult to reliably and effectively interfere with primarily because of our ignorance of how to achieve this. This, however, may change as understanding of our wetware increases and subtle direct manipulations of our brain chemistry can be employed to influence our behaviour. A highly granular version of this approach is likely still quite far off but it generally feels more viscerally scary than influencing us via our technology. Surfing the web without ad-block already feels uncomfortably close to the futurama gag about ads in your dreams. Increasing though this is amounting to the same thing. Indeed our technology is already doing this to us, albeit fairly crudely for now, by exploiting our reward circuits and many other subtle systematic flaws in the human psyche.\n\nWhat is “free” software? Free as in liberty no as in gratuity, as in speech not beer, politically and not necessarily financially. The free software foundation defines free software as adhering to the four essential freedoms which I paraphrase here:\n\nThe freedom to run the code however you wish\nThe freedom to examine its source code so that you can understand and modify it for your own purposes\nThe freedom to distribute the source code as is\nThe freedom to distribute modified versions of the source code\n\nNote that code which is ‘source available’ only really gets you freedom 1, depending on how the code is licenced and built this may not get you any of the others including freedom 0. Much ink has been spilt over the use of the term ‘open source’ as not going far enough as a result. Free software is often referred to by the acronyms FOSS & FLOSS (Free/Libre and open source software)\n\nThe occasionally controversial but ever prescient Richard Stallman (AKA RMS, AKA saint IGNUcius) has been banging on about the problems of proprietary software for nearly forty years at this point. Having essentially predicted the abuses of today’s software giants because he got a bad printer diver in the early 1980s.\nThe problem that Stallman saw with ‘proprietary’ software, i.e. software which does not meet the criteria of the four essential freedoms, is one of game theoretic incentives. Making software free serves as a pre-commitment mechanism by the software authors to not abuse the users of their software. This works by empowering users to exercise a credible threat of forking the project and cutting devs abusing their position out of the project and any associated revenue streams. Revenue from free software projects can take a number of forms e.g. premium-hosting, donations/pay-what-it’s-worth schemes, & service/support agreements, though how to successfully monetise free software remains a hard problem.\nAs the maker of a piece of propriety software, you are not subject to this kind of check on your power and it is often in your interest to increase lock-in to your product from your users to make it hard for them to leave for a competitor, should they become dissatisfied. The lack of transparency on how proprietary software works can also hide a multitude of sins such as bad security practices and provides scope for extensive surveillance of the users whilst maintaining deniability. Thus free software can serve as a solution to an alignment problem between makers and users of the software.\nThe speculative fiction of Cory Doctorow and Greg Egan in ‘permutation city’, along with the speculative (non-fiction?) of Robin Hanson in ‘Age of em’ has painted pictures of numerous diverse dystopian futures in which software is used to curtail individual liberties, as well as to gas-light, frame control, and otherwise manipulate or abuse people and other conscious entities.\nConcerns over these potential abuses have been gaining increasing popular attention in recent years though the emphasis has been placed on Shoshana Zuboff‘s concept of surveilance capitalism rather than framing the problem, as I suspect Stallman would, as having its root causes in non-free software. In particular, the popularity of the Netflix documentary’The Social Dilema’ made in collaboration with Tristan Harris & Aza Raskin’s Centre for human technology has increased public awareness of the problems, solutions, however, remain relatively unspecified.\nComputing is becoming ever more ubiquitous, connected and is beginning to be embedded in our bodies, though mostly still as medical devices for now. Whose phone numbers do you know, what about addresses or how to travel there? How’s your mental arithmetic? how good is your recall of your chat history with all your friends - would you notice it if was subtly edited in retrospect? Do you have a voice assistant? When was the last time you left your house without your phone? The more of our cognition takes place external to our brains the more vulnerable we are to the technological capture of our thought processes by misaligned entities. If we do not take measures to ensure the alignment of software makers interests with those of software users we invite dystopias galore.\nOver the years there have been many explicit efforts by technology companies to lock general-purpose computing devices to vendor-approved applications (e.g. many game consoles & iPhones). This is often in the name of copyright protection and increasingly in recent years in the name of providing better security. ‘Better security’ of course begs the question, against what threat model? It’s better security against malicious 3rd parties but what if I’m worried about what the 1st parties are doing? It comes down to the question of who holds the keys to the locks. I know I’d want to be the one deciding who’s signing keys I trust to go in the future-TPM-analog of the computer system emulating my brain and given their track records it’s probably not Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook I’m sorry Meta - rolls eyes, or Microsoft. (The basic competencies, understanding, and good widely adopted low friction systems needed for individuals to be good stewards of their own private keys is a problem in the locked bootloader space as well as the cryptocurrency space.) It is worth noting that at this point in time it is almost impossible and extremely impractical to get a completely free software computer down to the firmware level.\nI think a strong case could be made that a ‘freedom of compute’ should be enshrined in future constitutional settlements on par with freedom of speech as a protection of fundamental freedoms, in service to preserving freedom of thought. FOSS development has been discussed in the EA community as a potentially valuable intervention. Developers seem to be overrepresented in the rationalist community so maybe this is a bit of a touchy subject for any of us working on proprietary code. I’m of the opinion that we as a community should advocate for free software and that there is a certain synergy between the free software movement’s goals and those of the rationality community, I’d be interested to hear contrary opinions.\nWell-aligned software has the potential to massively improve our lives both at the individual and societal levels, look at what Taiwan is doing with open software in digital governance. Making use of some of the same behavioural modification tricks currently used to sell us crap we don’t need and immiserate us as a side effect so that we can be sold the cure can be turned to good. Helping us to establish good habits, to break bad ones and beat akrasia. To collaborate and communicate more deeply and effectively, instead of more shallowly and ineffectually. To be understood not misunderstood, seen for who we are and not through the funhouse mirror of beautification filters. To build a fun world together, not a depressing and solipsistic one.\nDisclosure: I am an associate member of the FSF, and pay them an annual membership fee & the link on ‘beginning to be embedded in our bodies’ is a shamelessly self-promotional link to an episode of my podcast were my co-host and I discuss embedded tech and its implications at length"

It has many features and extensions that could potential fulfil all your exobrain app categories for notes, calandar & tasks. The key feature for me is calendar and contacts (this can include calendar based tasks for those who use their email’s todo list)\n\nNextcloud features (too many to mention so some highlights, there are also extensions with apps\n\nNextcloud Deck for Kanban - style task boards\nCalendar/contacts sync and management via webDAV with web interfaces\nIntegration with A choice of 2 collaborative document editors Collabra (libreoffice) and onlyoffice\ndedicated Mobile apps for tasks, recipes and other things.\n\nHow to Host nextcloud\n\nTo self-host nextcloud I recommend setting up a TrueNAS on which to host a nexcloud instance. It has a simple interface to do this and is built of the highly robust ZFS file system which provides the advanced user with what I regard as the best available guarantees or data integrity and security available in any storage solution, especially for secure encrypted off-site backups.\n\nAdvanced note, encrypted ZFS raw snapshots should be pulled from your NAS by a remote backup system which never sees the encryption key and by a user with only the permissions necessary to do this sync over ssh. Your NAS should not be able to access the remote system over ssh only the other way around and limited to only running the sync command by configuring restrictions in authorized_keys (consult Jim Salter ARS technica blog for advanced ZFS tips)\n\nAdvanced mode - roll your own Linux host, there are many ways to do this.\nMany virtual private server providers offer ‘1-click’ deployments of Nextcloud e.g. Linode however you are still entrusting your data to a 3rd party if you take this approach\n\nNextcloud alternatives:\n\nCryptpad - very good lacks the extensibility of Nextcloud, has a paid hosting option Security and encryption model are baked into the design unlike Nextcloud which it is easier to insecurely misconfigure\nFile sync only **syncthing*\n\n\nNOT FULLY OPEN tailscale VPN This tool makes it very simple to keep your home servers on closed VPN whilst easily being able to access them from anywhere. The service for which there is a free (financially) tier handles the key exchange but once established all traffic is peer to peer over a wireguard based mesh network. There is a self-hostable but less featurefull key exchange server for the uber-paranoid with some extra computer networking skills. (Note that this is distinct from using a VPN to obscure the point of origin of your web traffic for this I currently recommend Mullvad VPN for a number of reasons including that you can pay anonymously with monero)\nNotes Apps\n\nlogseq - My Current Favourite. Somewhat similar to obsidian\nemacs org mode & org roam (emacs is ostensibly a text editor but it’s more of a lifestyle)\nCarnet a google keep-like Nextcloud note app\nJoplin - markdown based notes app (web/desktop/mobile), cloud hosted option or many other could sync options including nextcloud, quick grab browser plugins\ntiddlywiki A non-linear personal notebook in the form of a WIKI, local or hostable\nfocalboard notion-like\nappflowy notion-like\nminder for fans of mind mapping\nDendron for VScode/(VScodium) aficionados\nZotero Ideal for academics who need a reference manager, supports notes and PDF annotations tags etc. has many integrations including with logseq. This make a good supplement to a notes system for managing source materials that you reference in your notes. It also has a built in feed reader which facilitates the import of new articles ets. into your library. For biosciences people this pairs nicely with the feature in PubMed that lets you turn any search into an RSS feed (just click the create rss button under the search box). There is a web version with a nice sharing feature.\n\nTask management\n\nsuper-productivity - sleek task and time management with web, desktop & mobile apps. Syncs via popular cloud storage options and webDAV\nNextcloud deck - kanban like task management within Nexcloud\nNextcloud Tasks\nplanner - has todoist integration and sync, alternatively CalDAV based sync (desktop only)\ntodo.txt format editors e.g. go-for-it & sleek for those who like text files but also pretty guis. sync is just file sync.\nWeekToDo a task manager/planner which may integrate well with the weekly review strategy (desktop & webapp only)\n\nCalendar\n\nKOrganiser - a desktop calendar client which can sync with remote calendars, excellent views and highly customisable (alternatively kalendar for a slightly simpler interface)\nNextcloud Calendar\nlightning calendar for thunderbird mail interfaces with a calDAV calendar\n(NON-FREE proton and tutanota calandars for privacy)\n\nPassword / private key management\n\nbitwarden\n\ncloud based password manager with a self-hostable option, very featureful\n\nkeepass\n\nsee keepassxc for a better frontend\n\nNOT FULLY OPEN but get some Yubikeys to use as your Second factor in multi factor authentication, this is better than TOTP codes. (avoid SMS 2FA if at all possible, number spoofing is an issue)\n\n(Specially for data science types)\n\nIf you need a collaborative environment for analysis/development with reproducible containerised computation in Python/R (with jupyter/Rstudio) and dataset sharing, gitlab integrations and git-lfs then Renku is for you"

Hardware wise nothing ideal exists, what would be desirable is a phone with hardware dip switches which physically disconnect the wi-fi/bluetooth, cellular modem, camera & microphone as well as having a removable battery, an eSIM and a re-lockable boot-loader. Many phones running a mainline linux kernel still lack or have buggy basic functionality though android app emulation options are improving with the waydroid project.\n\ncalyxOS is among my prefered de-googled android options, but limited to specific hardware mainly google pixel phones\nLineage OS is less hardcore and will permit you to have a minimum viable google services option and work if you don’t have a locked boot-loader, available on many more handsets\n\nsilent-link will permit you to acquire an anonymous phone number which can be used with your calyxOS phone with an eSIM This number is data only or SMS and inbound voice only, NO OUTBOUND CALLS It should be used in conjunction with a VOIP service for all actual calls. It can be paid for anonymously with monero.\n\nnote use a roaming phone not one from your own country this dramatically reduced the data available about you to the telecoms providers.\nYour phone’s IMEI is still a unique identifier so you can be de-anonymised by cross referencing it with your location data from other sources. It is often illegal to change this number but swapping between a few different eSIMs can get you part way of the way there as this changes your IMEI with each eSIM.\n\nDesktop PCs are if anything worse in some regards than phones but less of a liability with respect to location data and at least with better alternative software options which match or exceed the capabilities of the main commercial options. Use a well regarded Linux Distro encrypt your data and update regularly, macOS and windows are privacy nightmares."

Yes the figure and its legend are sometimes on different pages (I’m looking at you Cell WTF?). To drive this point home you can be looking at a situation like this: Figure 6(i) was discussed on page 4, printed on page 5 and the legend for which is, for some ungodly reason, printed on page 6! Oh and also the title for the figure is not on the figure but in the legend and helpfully features (YATA) yet another terrible acronym that was defined once in the abstract on page 1.\nI don’t know about you but a mere mortal such as myself needs some working memory spare to think about the underlying concepts that a manuscript is trying to communicate to me, and I do not appreciate having to cache as many a 4 look-up tables in my head just to be able to effectively read a figure, let alone reason further about it!\nI contend that this problem is worse when looking at electronic representations of formats meant to be printed, at least in part because it is easier to form a mental map of the relationships between these different parts of the manuscript when it is printed. When you have a physical copy the parts have relationships to one another in 3D space that take less effort to construct a mental model of. Also, it’s just easier to arrange the pages so can actually look at the different parts and the same time. e-reader like formats also suffer from this issue as they don’t have fixed pagination so the relationships between objects are still harder to model as they are not even in fixed relationship to one another in a virtual 2D space.\nI hypothesize that breaking up figure panels and placing figures in line in the text as they occur would increase reading speed and comprehension, especially in electronic media. I term this information-non locality minimization. This also entails placing information such as titles, abbreviations, and other small details like summary statistics in the figure itself. This instead of unnecessarily relegating this information to figure legends.\nSpecific hypotheses I’d like to see tested:\n\nTime taken to read a paper with multi-panel figures will be longer than the time taken when information-non locality is minimised.\nReading comprehension tests will be worse for papers with multi-panel figures than when information-non locality is minimised.\nHypotheses 1 & 2 will be true of both electronic and physical media but the effect size will be larger for electronic media.\nBound copies of papers with multi-panel figures will provide less of an advantage over information-non locality minimised copies than loose-leaf / unbound prints.\nEffect size of the advantage information-non locality minimized versions have over multi-panel figure versions will be larger in people with dyslexia. (I’m dyslexic and it’s been thought of as an issue related to working memory, it may be why this issue jumps out at me.)\n\nIf anyone wants to do this research please get in touch. If my hypotheses on reading speed and comprehension work out it would be a ‘fun’ exercise to compute an estimate for how much our collective time and money we have wasted because of bad formatting choices.\nWhy are we wasting time, energy and mental cycles mentally reassembling properly constructed figures from their component parts which we have strewn willy-nilly throughout our manuscripts? To sum up Multi-panel figures are an anachronistic concession to typesetting colour prints to a compact format for printing and they have no place in modern electronic publishing. They ruin the flow of reading a paper. They represent an unreasonable assault on the working memory resources of a reader who is trying to understand what is likely a complex topic and create undue cognitive load for readers who need their full mental faculties about them to grapple with complex scientific ideas.\nAdditionally, I think that they encourage bad graphical practices. Panels are labelled not with meaningfully interpretable titles, as both our schooling and basic common sense about presenting information dictates they should, be but with alphabet soup. These are bad practices for which we take school children to task in science classes but which we seem to have collectively forgotten in the peer-reviewed literature. Multi-panel figures should be used ONLY when it is actually useful for the understanding of the content for visuals to be placed together. We don’t need to optimize for printing in electronic formats we can have as many full-size colour figures as we need to optimally convey our point. This would be an improvement even if we stick to pdfs as the primary endpoint paradigm for published articles, the case against which deserves its own discussion."

    "text": "Picture a subset of your network of beliefs, let us take a simplified section that looks like a tree, stripping away the complex interconnections to aid in visualization.\nBeliefs B and C are predicated on belief A, beliefs D and E on belief B, and beliefs F and G on belief C. Thus belief A is need for beliefs B and C, belief B for D and E, and C for F and G. (see the figure)\n\n\nThe One: Apples grow on trees - lets us call this belief F.\nThe Other: What are trees? and why are you labeling your beliefs with letters?\nThe one is trying to convince the other of F but the other lacks belief C (the belief in trees), the one is unable to successfully graft the branch of their tree containing F onto the other’s tree as their is no suitable node at which to affix it.\nThe one must then traverse back down their tree to node C and first convince the other of C. The one made the mistake of thinking the inferential distance between themself and the other was but 1 node when in actuality it was 2. The one must convince the other not merely that apples grow on trees but must also introduce the concept of trees.\nThe One: Trees are large upright plants with stiff bodies due in part to large amounts of lignin in some of their cell walls, a property not shared by they bendier cousins. There is one over their with apples growing on it. (points to a nearby apple tree)\n\nAssessing the inferential distance between yourself and your interlocutor can often be accomplished by the asking of questions which prompt an explication of their belief structure. It also helps here if you have exercised good epistemic hygiene and can clearly identify the path you must take in order to converge. The concept of inferential distance is interestingly related to finding the double crux of a disagreement, you must traverse back through your belief network until you find the relevant point of difference in your network or the genuine source of your disagreement. Indeed inferential distance may be measured by the number of iterations of the double crux game algorithm you have to execute find the crux. Once the extent of the gulf between you has been assayed you may begin to devise a path to traverse it.\nThere is a distinction to be drawn between adding a new node to an interlocutor’s belief network when the desired new node is not in obvious tension with other beliefs held by the interlocutor, and the condition where you are attempting to displace an existing node with a different mutually exclusive one. The former is often much easier than the latter.\n\nThe Other: There is not such thing as trees.\nThe One: let us call that belief C’, What then is yonder plant with apples growing on it? (points to a nearby apple tree)\nThe Other: That is just an unusually large fern. The One: sigh\nThe Other believes C’ which they are aware is mutually exclusive with C.\n\nPlaying the double crux game with those not initiated in it (the weak version) can can be challenging. Taking a Socratic approach with genuine expressions of curiosity about what exactly your interlocutor believes can be effective at causing your interlocutor to notice when they are expressing a belief in belief as opposed to one that pays rent in anticipated experiences as they should be encouraged by your curiosity to explain to you exactly why they believe what they believe.\nDepending on your interlocutor and subject you may wish to begin incrementally to bridge the void, node by node. It is a common error to attempt to plant whole sections of your belief tree in infertile soil and to grow frustrated when it fails to take root. Complex, obscure or controversial issues are frequently best tackled stepwise, especially when in dialog with someone not yet explicitly committed to a rationalist approach or otherwise high in Doxastic Openness.\nSome branches of the tree which you may wish to graft onto others will have deeply rooted dependencies which run back to fundamental epistemic differences and will present a major challenge to make them successfully take. Some branches however have shallow dependencies and can easily be transfered even between those with but a single necessary belief in common. This can be strategically important as people may believe the same thing for different or even invalid reasons and pointing this out can be detrimental in the short term if you are running a “Mothers Against Drunk Driving” style single issue campaign (Potential Dark Side Applications Warning).\nSee This post at Less wrong"
