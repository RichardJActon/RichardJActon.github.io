I made another appearance on the [bayesian conspiracy podcast](https://www.thebayesianconspiracy.com/2023/05/187-github-review-bounties-to-save-science-with-richard-acton/) to talk about the sorry state of academic publishing and some things we might be able to do to fix it including my concept of Review Bounties.
