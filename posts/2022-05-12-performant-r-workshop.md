title: Performant R - how to do things faster in R
strand: R
---

I recently ran a workshop on writing performant R code you can find the slides at [Performant R](https://richardjacton.github.io/performantR/Performant_R.html).

I took a very wide overview of the subject covering profiling and benchmarking, vectorising, parallelism, Rcpp, and working with larger than memory datasets as well as caching of computationally results with compressed data object outputs and pipeline managment tools.
There are links to further reading/watching in the presenter notes and the [git repo](https://github.com/RichardJActon/performantR).
