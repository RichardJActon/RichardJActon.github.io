Now that my [PhD Thesis](https://richardjacton.github.io/thesis/) is available online I thought I would update my blog to point to it in case anyone want to read it.
It's hosted here on github pages and was written in Rmarkdown and built with the [bookdown](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/) package.
