I recently published a short ebook that I've been working on as a part of my role at the Human Developmental Biology Initiative.
I'm calling it "Data: Inception to Publication & Beyond".

The focus is on creating a workflow for streamlined generation, analysis, & publication of FAIR research data with reproducible analyses both in theory and practice.
